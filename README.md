Build project

	$ gradlew build
# Language
	Kotlin
	
# Development
The project follows MVVM architecture with AndroidX libraries. Dagger is used heavily for dependancy injection as it helps to avoid error-prone boilerplate code and makes unit testing efficient. 
	
The project also implements interceptors for logging, caching and offline management. Also, when the user scrolls to the bottom of the list the subsequent pages are fetched via pagination. 
	
The images in the application are lazy loaded using Picasso library which is also injected by Dagger

TDD is followed for the development of the application. Red, Green, Refactor approach of TDD is followed to efficiantly model the classes and inject dependancies.
